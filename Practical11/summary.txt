My summary of Implementation of a sequence comparison program in Python
/result/
huamn Vs mouse:  the alignment is 1091, there are 89.64% of acids are identical;
human Vs ramdon: the alignment is -250, there are 5.41% of acids are identical;
mouse Vs ramdon: the alignment is -250, there are 5.86% of acids are identical.
/steps/
I searched for a dictionary online, but since it was only half of it, I wrote some code to improve it. Then amino acids were compared one by one.
/Interpretation/
A higher score in the matrix means a higher degree of similarity.
The score of human_mouse sequence comparison is large, and the score of human/mouse_random sequence comparison is small. Since we use the human/mouse_random sequence comparison as control groups, it indicates that human and mouse sequence have a high degree of similarity. This result is also consistent with ratio of identical acids.

From the evolutionary point of view, we can speculate that these two sequences have the same origin.
From a biological point of view, we can speculate that this sequence which is evolutionarily conserved may be a housekeeping gene.
