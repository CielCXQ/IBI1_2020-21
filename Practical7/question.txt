question: What proportion of cases have died (as of the latest information) in Germany? What proportion of cases have died in the UK?
Line number:72-97
Results: The results found a much higher mortality rate of 6.3% in the UK than 0.94% in Germany. This is not particularly in line with my expectations, as the German epidemic grew very rapidly in the later stages. Probably due to the good situation in the early stages of the epidemic, the government and hospitals were better prepared, so in the treatment was higher. It is also possible that due to the low number of infections in the earlier period, most people were still in hospital before the deadline and the number of deaths remained low. But the UK also had more patients in the earlier period, so it has higher mortality rates.
